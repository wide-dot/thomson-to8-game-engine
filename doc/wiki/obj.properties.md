## obj.properties


### Assembly code

The sprite is firstly associated to its own assembly code, using the following syntax :


```
code=./objects/enemies/01/bink/obj.asm
```


(The root is the project itself)


### Frames

Each frame of a sprite is defined with the following syntax (one line for each frame) : 


```
sprite.Img_bink_0=./objects/enemies/01/bink/images/bink_00.png;NB0,NB1
```


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
Object
   </td>
   <td>Definition
   </td>
   <td>Description
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>sprite.<strong>Img_bink_0</strong></code>
   </td>
   <td>The sprite name
   </td>
   <td>The object starts with sprite. followed by a chosen name (for example, the sprite name and frame number)
<p>
In the given example, “bink” represents the sprite name, and 0 its frame.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong><code>./objects/enemies/01/bink/images/bink_00.png</code></strong>
   </td>
   <td>The path to the PNG file
   </td>
   <td>The path is always relative to the project root folder.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong><code>NB0,NB1</code></strong>
   </td>
   <td>Compilation options
   </td>
   <td>You can define how the engine is going to compile the sprite. You can select multiple options, using a comma in between each.
<p>
First option : 
<ul>

<li>N specifies a “normal” sprite, oriented as you designed it

<li>X specified a horizontal flip of the sprite

<li>Y specifies a vertical flip of the sprite

<li>XY specifies both a horizontal and  vertical flip of the sprite

<p>
Second option : 
<ul>

<li>B (background) specifies that the backgroun of the sprite will need to be saved and restored

<li>D (draw) means that the background does not need to be saved (and restored)

<p>
Third option :  \

<ul>

<li>0 : Create the sprite at position 0

<li>1 : Create the sprite at position 1 (shift by 1 pixel to the right). This is to allow a single pixel movement

<p>
Example : 
<p>
I want my sprite frame to be compiled with the possibility of moving by 1 pixel (hence with 1 shift), with saving of the background and its equivalent with horizontal flipping (mirror) as my sprite can move right or left with a flipped design.
<p>
My sprite options would therefore be : 
<p>
<code>NB0,NB1,XB0,XB1</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



### Animations

The sequence of animation between a same sprite frames can be specified with the following syntax : 


```
animation.Ani_bink=2;Img_bink_3;Img_bink_2;Img_bink_3;Img_bink_1;_resetAnim
```

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>

Object
   </td>
   <td>Definition
   </td>
   <td>Description
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>sprite.<strong>Ani_bink</strong></code>
   </td>
   <td>Assembly jump point
   </td>
   <td>This defines where, in the assembly code (obj.asm) the sprite will be executed.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong><code>2</code></strong>
   </td>
   <td>Frame rate
   </td>
   <td>This defines when the sprite is rotated to its next frame : 
<ul>

<li>1 means every game frame

<li>2 means every other game frames

<li>3 means every 3 game frames

<li>… etc …
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong><code>Img_bink_3;Img_bink_2;Img_bink_3;Img_bink_1;_resetAnim</code></strong>
   </td>
   <td>Animation sequence
   </td>
   <td>This specifies the frames order the sprite will be animated.
<p>
Each frame name refers to the frames created (See “Frames” section above) and are separated by a semicolon ;
<p>
The animation is closed by one of the following options :
<ul>
<li>_resetAnim : Loops the animation back from start
<li>_goBackNFrames : loops the animation back N frames (e.g. _goBackNFrames;3 would loop from 3 frames back)
<li>_goToAnimation : ??? Move to another defined animation (e.g. _goToAnimation:Ani_bink_explosion)
<li>_nextRoutine : ???
<li>_resetAnimAndSubRoutine : ???
<li>_nextSubRoutine : ???
</ul>
